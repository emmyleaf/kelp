[x] Write this todo list - scan through Lutra code for necessary features for kelp
[ ] Camera proj/view matrix calculation
[ ] Push constant for camera matrix (falls back to uniform on OpenGL via wgpu)
[ ] Custom pipelines created on demand
    [ ] Blend modes
    [ ] Custom fragment shaders
        [ ] Shader parameters - do we keep the dynamic API or design something stricter?
        [ ] Write guide to writing custom shaders (maybe this belongs in Lutra docs...)
[ ] Drawing to different surfaces
[ ] Separate final surface to window stage
