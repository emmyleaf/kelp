- [x] Write this todo list - scan through Lutra code for necessary features for kelp
- [x] Camera proj/view matrix calculation
- [x] Push constant for camera matrix (falls back to uniform on OpenGL via wgpu)
- [x] Split C ffi into a separate crate
- [x] Pass clear colour in to `begin_render_pass` as an `Option<>`
- [x] Drawing to different `RenderTarget`s
    - Separate final surface to window stage - this can just be done in Lutra as before
- [x] Allow an instance to be drawn 'Very smoot...' (linear sampled)
- [@] Custom pipelines created on demand
    - [x] Blend modes
    - [ ] Custom fragment shaders
        - Shader parameters - describe the layout at creation time
        - What if we open up the remaining 64 bytes of push constants? that will cover most shaders used in tmfbma/dddb
        - Will still need a binding slot for texture/buffer parameters etc
        - Write guide to writing custom shaders (maybe this belongs in Lutra docs...)
- [x] Avoid setting pipeline when it doesn't need to change - too much overhead for every draw call
- [x] Imgui rendering! (based on `imgui-wgpu`)
- [x] Allow multiple world transforms per instance from API - condense to one matrix for GPU still of course
    - Not super happy with this, but it will work for now while hooking up Lutra!
- [x] Add whole batches of instances at a time - Lutra will ideally dump a whole buffers worth once it fills up
- [x] Use `interoptopus` crate to generate C# bindings!
- [x] Fix texture handling by caching them and returning ids instead of owning and sending boxed pointers
- [x] Add error handling to the rust API
- [x] Remove the FFIResult type - custom CTypeInfo impls can help interoptopus generate correct out params
- [ ] Removing textures: intend for removal in batches - invalidate bind group cache to be rebuilt on next use?
- [x] Data-oriented inputs: render data contains an array of instances and and array of batches
- [@] API usability improvements
