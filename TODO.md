- [x] Write this todo list - scan through Lutra code for necessary features for kelp
- [x] Camera proj/view matrix calculation
- [x] Push constant for camera matrix (falls back to uniform on OpenGL via wgpu)
- [x] Split C ffi into a separate crate
- [x] Pass clear colour in to `begin_render_pass` as an `Option<>`
- [ ] Drawing to different `RenderTarget`s
- [ ] Separate final surface to window stage
- [x] Allow an instance to be drawn 'Very smoot...' (linear sampled)
- [@] Custom pipelines created on demand
    - [x] Blend modes
    - [ ] Custom fragment shaders
        - Shader parameters - do we keep the dynamic API or design something stricter?
        - What if we open up the remaining 64 bytes of push constants? that will cover most shaders used in tmfbma/dddb
        - Will still need a binding slot for texture/buffer parameters etc
        - Write guide to writing custom shaders (maybe this belongs in Lutra docs...)
- [@] Imgui rendering! (based on `imgui-wgpu`)
    - [ ] update C ffi and make sure we can shunt ImGui draw data from Lutra
- [ ] Allow multiple world transforms per instance from API - condense to one matrix for GPU still of course
- [ ] Add whole batches of instances at a time - Lutra will ideally dump a whole buffers worth once it fills up
- [ ] Look into `interoptopus` crate for making the bindings!
